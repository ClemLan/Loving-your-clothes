    <p>Launched in 2014, the Love Your Clothes campaign has been developed together with industry organisations to help change the way the UK consumers buy, use and dispose of their clothing.
       <br>Love Your Clothes is part of the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), which is coordinated by WRAP, a not-for-profit organisation which receives Government support across the UK.

  <h2> Buying clothes</h2>

    <p> Loving your clothes starts with smarter buying. No more flimsy fabric and skimpy stitching that falls apart the minute you get it home.</p>

      <img src="../images/buying clothes 2.jpg">
    <p> Buying smarter can mean choosing clothes that are better made, and that will be a doddle to care for. Or maybe you don’t need to buy at all – you could hire or swap instead.
    <br>Buying pre-loved clothes can also be a fabulous way of getting a new look for a fraction of High Street prices.
    And vintage clothes mean you can be both chic and unique.
